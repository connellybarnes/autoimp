1.0.4   2015-08-30
 * Alias 'numpy' as 'np' if it is available, since use of 'np' is common.

1.0.3   2015-08-29
 * Python 3 support.
   - Connelly Barnes

(In use from 2006 to 2015, but no releases).

1.0.2   2006-09-12
 * Added autoimp._export_builtins(), which exports all available modules
   to the builtin namespace.  Use this in sitecustomize.py for editors
   which do not run PYTHONPATH or editors such as IDLE which do not run
   PYTHONPATH after executing a script.
   - Connelly Barnes

1.0.1   2006-07-19
 * Decreased time that it takes to initially import 'autoimp': we now
   use a custom algorithm which determines whether a given module in
   the filesystem is importable rather than using imp.find_module().
 * The new algorithm also fixes a bug where arbitrary directories were
   considered to be packages and imported even though they lack
   __init__.py .

1.0.0   2006-06-11
 * Initial release
